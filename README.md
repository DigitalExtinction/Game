Digital Extinction ([de-game.org](https://de-game.org/),
[Documentation](https://docs.de-game.org/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/DigitalExtinction/Game),
[Discord](https://discord.gg/vHMFuCWGSX)) is a 3D real-time strategy (RTS)
game. It is set in the near future when humans and AI fight over their
existence.

It is [open source & free software](#license). Forever! It runs on Linux,
Windows and potentially other platforms.

The game is completely written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with
[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) used as the engine.

# Status

The game is still in [the early phases](#roadmap) of its development. If you
are looking for a mature game, come back in a few months.

Feedback, bug reports, and other [contributions](#contributing) are welcome.

# How to Play?

Game controls & gameplay tutorial is at
[docs.de-game.org/tutorial/](https://docs.de-game.org/tutorial/).

## Downloading Nightly Builds

Build from `main` branch is automatically published every night as a ZIP
archive. The archive contains:

* all necessary game assets,
* main game binary (`de` or `de.exe`),
* DE Lobby binary (`de-lobby` or `de-lobby.exe`),
* and DE Connector binary (`de-connector` or `de-connector.exe`).

Follow these steps to start the game on your computer:

1. Download nightly ZIP file for your OS and CPU:

   * [Linux (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`)](https://download.de-game.org/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/nightly.zip)
   * [Windows (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)](https://download.de-game.org/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/nightly.zip)
   * [macOS with M series (`aarch64-apple-darwin`)](https://download.de-game.org/aarch64-apple-darwin/nightly.zip)
   * [macOS with Intel (`x86_64-apple-darwin`)](https://download.de-game.org/x86_64-apple-darwin/nightly.zip)

2. Extract the ZIP file.

3. Execute binary file called `de` or `de.exe`.

## Building from Source

What you need:

* installed and configured Git
* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Clone, build & run recipe (will work in the majority of the cases):

* `git clone git@github.com:DigitalExtinction/Game.git DigitalExtinction`
* `cd DigitalExtinction`
* make sure that Git LFS files in [assets/](assets/) are pulled
* `cargo run --release`

# Build Profiles

## Testing Profile

On top of the standard Cargo build profiles, there is a `testing` profile
optimized for manual testing. In this profile, extra checks and debug info are
included in the build. LTO is disabled and the optimization level is fine-tuned
for fast compilation times while keeping performance reasonable.

## LTO Profile

Profile `lto` shares configuration with `release` profile but enables LTO.

# Cargo Build Features

The following are the Cargo [build
features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) supported by
the game. These features enable special functionality that can be useful during
development, testing, and experimentation.

## godmode

`godmode` makes it possible to control all game entities (i.e. enemy units and
buildings).

# Goals

Many of the goals are intentionally vague and aspirational. They serve as a
general direction for future development. All changes and decisions shall go
hand in hand with the spirit of the following goals.

* Develop a forever free (as in free speech) and open source RTS game. A game
  without the restraints of commercial development – no marketing-motivated
  features, no dopamine traps, no in-game purchases…

* Design an original game, not yet another clone of an existing (and often a
  very old) game. The game is a combination of tried and true concepts and
  mechanics from the RTS genre with new and innovative ideas.

* Create a true **strategy** game, where dexterity or APS do not play the
  primary role.

* Focus on exponential in-game technological and economical progress. Players
  who consistently outperform their competitors for extended times prevail.
  Short-term boosts and performance fluctuations do have a proportionately
  small impact on the game results.

* Produce a modern game, unchained from obsoleted constraints and utilizing
  current technology. Truly utilize the power of modern multi-core CPUs and
  other capable hardware with the help of advances in software development,
  like fearless concurrency of Rust programming language, or ECS-based Bevy
  engine.

  Seize this technological opportunity to create an RTS of grand scale, with
  hundreds of buildings and thousands of fully simulated units on the game map.

* Develop the game indefinitely and incrementally. To regularly ship a new
  version (rolling release) and to forever improve the game based on new
  experiences and new ideas.

* Show that non-trivial games could be created in Rust and by extension Bevy
  engine.

of Rust.

# Roadmap

Bellow is a high-level roadmap. Also, see [Issue
#246](https://github.com/DigitalExtinction/Game/issues/246) with a detailed
path toward version 1.0.

1. [Proof of Concept
   (PoC)](https://github.com/DigitalExtinction/Game/milestone/1)
1. Prioritize in development cycles, each organized in a GitHub milestone named
   Run N. For example [Run
   2](https://github.com/DigitalExtinction/Game/milestone/4).
1. Release (first) [version
   1.0](https://github.com/DigitalExtinction/Game/milestone/2)
1. [Indefinitely improve the game](/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-process)

## Proof of Concept

This is an embarrassingly bare bones game. It is complete in the sense that you
can start the game, play against someone and win or loose.

At this stage, the game is too bare bones to be enjoyable. The UI/UX misses
some very important features (like seeing what units are selected, ability to
see health / energy of units, and so on).

The goal of this milestone is to lay down the foundations, setup basic
infrastructure (GitHub Actions, issues labels, …) and achieve an important
psychological milestone.

## 1.0

This is the first published version of the game. In theory, this should be the
earliest possible version, minimizing development time and effort, which is
threshold enjoyable for an actual player.

As opposed to PoC, this version has all the basic UI to make the UX acceptable.
The game mechanics are somewhat expanded so it is no longer thoroughly “dummy”.
